Imaging hydrogen atoms has long been a challenging task in the field of electron microscopy. Here, we report the use of multi-slice electron ptychography (MEP) to image hydrogen atoms within high-entropy alloys (HEAs). This achievement marks only the third time in the history of electron microscopy that hydrogen atoms have been successfully imaged.
