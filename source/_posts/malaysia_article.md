Yes Of Course! I love my country, Malaysia. The food is fantastic (I must write an article to introduc it!), the weather is pleasant, and the people are incredibly friendly. Though the government sucks, my love for my country remains unwavering.
I wrote several articles about my country.
This was my first published article, discussing the importance of made in Malaysia ,https://www.enanyang.my/node/380004 .
Recently, there has been a significant increase in the construction of data centers in Malaysia. I have written about this trend and its implications for the countryâ€™s digital infrastructure, https://www.enanyang.my/%E8%A8%80%E8%AE%BA/%E5%A4%A7%E9%A9%AC%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E4%B8%AD%E5%BF%83%E6%B5%AA%E6%BD%AE%E6%BD%98%E6%94%BF%E9%BA%9F.
I have authored two articles on the pros and cons of Malaysia's semiconductor industry, which were republished by the International Trade Administration of Taiwan. These articles delve into the strengths and challenges of Malaysia as a leading player in the packaging of semiconductors.
